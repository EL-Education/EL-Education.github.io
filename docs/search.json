The types of colors we use and the way in which we use them are quite different for these three cases. - Claus Wilke, Fundamentals of Data Visualization\n\nWhile we are free to use the EL palette for cases (i) and (iii) as appropriate, (ii) is trickier because our choice of color should match the type of data that we are representing. As such, we can use the EL palette as a base to create other palettes that more appropriately represent the data we are visualizing.\n\nShowing range with a Sequential Palette\n\n\nShowing divergence from a central value with a Divergent Palette\n\n\nShowing categories with a Qualitative Palette"
